# CLAUDE.md

## Project

Copter - A Slack bill-splitting bot inspired by KBANK's Khunthong. Built with TypeScript, Slack Bolt, and SQLite.

## Commands

- `pnpm install` — Install dependencies
- `pnpm build` — Compile TypeScript
- `pnpm dev` — Run dev server with hot reload

## Important Rules

**Keep documentation in sync with code.** Whenever source code is changed or updated, you MUST also update the following files to reflect those changes:

- **`plan.md`** — Implementation plan, phase status, feature descriptions, and project structure. Update phase checklists, feature descriptions, and any architectural details that changed.
- **`README.md`** — Project overview and quick start. Update if commands, features, or setup steps changed.
- **`SETUP_GUIDE.md`** — Slack app configuration and usage guide. Update if scopes, commands, user-facing behavior, or setup steps changed.

Do not consider a task complete until all three documentation files are verified and updated as needed.
